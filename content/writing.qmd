## Using Zotero and Quarto

-   Quarto Website info on using Zotero for citations <https://quarto.org/docs/visual-editor/technical.html#citations> 
-   Quick Quarto tutorial for inserting citations using Zotero <https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/authoring/rstudio.html#citations> 
-   Another quick tutorial from Quarto Tip of the Day <https://mine-cetinkaya-rundel.github.io/quarto-tip-a-day/posts/24-citations/> 
-   Questions and tips from Openscapes Sessions
    -   Can R markdown be linked to endnote for inserting citations into a document? 

        -   No, however Quarto can help with this! It can be integrated with citations (Zotero). More information on Quarto here: 
            -   <https://www.apreshill.com/blog/2022-04-we-dont-talk-about-quarto/>

    -   here's is an article that describes how to migrate an Endnote library to Zotero. <https://www.zotero.org/support/kb/endnote_import>

    -   PSA: New **Citation Style Library (.csl)** alert!

        -   Any journal!: <https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles> 
        -   New NOAA citation style: [https://www.zotero.org/styles?q=i%3aaps-no-ampersand](https://www.zotero.org/styles?q=id%3Aapa-no-ampersand)
        -   I (Em) recently spoke with AFSC comms about how to integrate the NOAA Fisheries AFSC citation style in rmarkdown/quarto/etc and (after also reaching out the the NOAA Central Library) all agreed that we can instead use the APA 7th Citation Style Language. Use the link above directly in R, Zotero, EndNote, etc! I believe this is a change that will be slowly implemented across NOAA (not just NOAA fisheries or the AFSC science center). 
        -   You are able to add a csl to your quarto/rmd by:
        -   In the yml of a quarto/rmd document:

        ![](images/Screenshot%202022-11-21%20111136.png){width="300"}

        -   In a universal quarto yml: 

        ![](images/Screenshot%202022-11-21%20111158.png){width="300"}
-   Citations (.bib/Zotero)
    -   <https://www.doi2bib.org/> put in a doi, get out a .bib!
    -   This is the guide Em usually refers to for exporting .bib (the .bib file can be used in Quarto to add citations) from endnote: <https://www.reed.edu/cis/help/LaTeX/EndNote.html> 
    -   Tanya: If you do have a Zotero library, how would you link that? Is that the only difference between quarto and rmd?
        -   Kevin S: Tanya, I have a Zotero library, never used Quarto, but when I tried a Quarto demo and typed \@ it somehow found my Zotero library, I think. Just try it.

        -   Go into RStudio Options \> R Markdown \> choose Citations tab and select which Zotero library you want to link

-   These are from a breakout room Shannon was in, I am not sure exactly what they talked about but I know it was related to using Zotero (maybe reach out to Shannon if you have questions about the links or anything!) 
    -   EndNote doesn't allow for external collaboration outside of NOAA

    -   Download .bib file from EndNote to add it to Zotero/Mendeley (to allow for external collaboration)
